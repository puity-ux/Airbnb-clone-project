üîê Key Security Measures and Their Importance

1. Authentication

What it is: Verifies the identity of users when they log in (e.g., using email & password, or multi-factor authentication).
Why it matters: Protects user accounts and personal data by ensuring only authorized individuals can access their profiles and sensitive information.


2. Authorization

What it is: Determines what authenticated users are allowed to do (e.g., a guest can book a property, but only a host can list one).
Why it matters: Prevents unauthorized actions by ensuring users only access features and data relevant to their role. This protects property and booking data from misuse.


3. Rate Limiting

What it is: Limits the number of requests a user or bot can make to the system in a given time frame.
Why it matters: Helps prevent abuse (e.g., brute-force login attacks or spamming booking endpoints) and protects server performance.


4. Input Validation & Sanitization

What it is: Checks and cleans data entered by users (e.g., names, messages, forms).
Why it matters: Prevents injection attacks (like SQL injection or XSS), which could compromise the database or front-end display.


5. Data Encryption

What it is: Converts sensitive data into a secure format during storage or transmission (e.g., using HTTPS, encrypting passwords).
Why it matters: Keeps private information like passwords, payment details, and user data secure, even if intercepted or breached.


6. Secure Payment Processing

What it is: Uses trusted third-party payment gateways (e.g., Stripe or PayPal) to handle transactions securely.
Why it matters: Ensures users‚Äô financial data is handled safely and reduces liability by outsourcing complex security compliance (like PCI-DSS).


7. Logging and Monitoring

What it is: Tracks user activity and system events for anomalies or suspicious behavior.
Why it matters: Helps detect breaches or abuse early, ensuring accountability and quick incident response.
