CI/CD Pipelines and Their Importance

CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment/Delivery. It is a development practice where code changes are automatically built, tested, and deployed. CI/CD pipelines help teams deliver software faster and more reliably by automating repetitive tasks like testing and deployment.

💡 Why CI/CD is Important
	•	Ensures code quality by automatically testing new changes.
	•	Speeds up development by reducing manual work.
	•	Reduces bugs in production by catching issues early.
	•	Supports collaboration by allowing multiple developers to push updates smoothly.

🛠️ Common CI/CD Tools
	•	GitHub Actions – Automates workflows directly from your GitHub repo.
	•	Docker – Creates lightweight containers to run your app consistently across environments.
	•	Jenkins – A powerful automation server for building and deploying projects.
